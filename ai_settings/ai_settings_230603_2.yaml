ai_goals:
- Make protein apo structure and ligand-only PDBs from 8gcy.pdb by using the Chemoinformatics plugin respectively.
- Read target_preparation_example.jsonc to know how to output setting json to run target protein preparation
- Update the setting json file to use the two PDBs you just created protein apo pdb and ligand Z3N.pdb, and output the file as 8gcy_preparation_setting.json.
- Run target protein preparation by using the Chemoinformatics plugin with 8gcy_preparation_setting.json
- Shutdown when task is done.
