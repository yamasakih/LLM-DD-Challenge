ai_goals:
- Read docking_example.jsonc to know how to output setting json to run docking ligand compound and target protein
- Update the setting json file to use the 8gcy_receptor.pdbqt created in target protein preparation and that log file 8gcy_target_prep.log. So you must assign `--center_x`, `--center_y`, `--center_z`, `--size_x`, `--size_y`, `--size_z` parameters in docking setting json with reference to target protein preparation log file. Each size parameter should be rounded up or otherwise margined after subtracting the min value from the max value. Output the file as docking_setting.json.
- Shutdown when task is done.
